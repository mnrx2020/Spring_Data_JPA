# Spring_Data_JPA
# Spring Boot Application with Spring Data JPA

This repository contains the implementation of a Spring Boot application using Spring Data JPA. The project demonstrates core concepts such as creating and managing entities, repositories, and handling database interactions with JPA, as well as implementing a modular and scalable application structure.

## Features

- Built with Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA.
- REST API implementation for managing entities.
- Entity relationships (OneToMany, ManyToOne, ManyToMany).
- CRUD operations via Spring Data JPA Repositories.
- Application configuration using `application.yml`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.8+ or Gradle
- Docker (optional, for running databases in containers)
- PostgreSQL or MySQL
- DBeaver (for database management)
- Postman (for API testing)

### Running the Application

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Spring_Boot_JPA.git
    cd Spring_Boot_JPA
    ```

2. **Set up `application.yml`**:
    The `application.yml` file contains sensitive configuration, such as database credentials, and is not included in the repository for security reasons.

    You will need to create your own `application.yml` file in the `src/main/resources/` directory.

    To create the file, you can either:
    - Copy from a template (if provided):
      ```bash
      cp src/main/resources/application.yml.template src/main/resources/application.yml
      ```
    - Or create it manually.

    Then, edit `application.yml` with your local settings:
    ```yaml
    spring:
      datasource:
        url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database
        username: your_username
        password: your_password
    ```

3. **Build and run the application**:

    - Using Maven:
      ```bash
      ./mvnw spring-boot:run
      ```

    - Or using Gradle:
      ```bash
      ./gradlew bootRun
      ```

4. **Access the application**:
    Once the application is running, you can access the REST API at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Database Configuration

- This application supports both PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.
- Modify the `application.yml` file according to the database you are using.

## API Documentation

You can use Postman or any other API testing tool to interact with the REST endpoints provided by the application. API routes are defined to handle common CRUD operations on entities.
